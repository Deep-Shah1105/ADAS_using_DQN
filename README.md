# ADAS_using_DQN
# Creating an AI Agent with Level 2 ADAS Integrated Using CARLA Simulator, DQN, LSTM, and Replay Buffer

## ðŸŸ£ Project Overview

This project aims to develop an **AI agent** that can perform **Level 2 ADAS** functionality â€” including lane-keeping, obstacle avoidance, and adaptive cruise control â€” within a realistic, scalable, and risk-free **CARLA** simulation environment.

To achieve this, we employ:
- **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** for policy learning.
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** to handle temporal dependency in sensor data.
- **Replay Buffer** to stabilize training by sampling past experiences.

## ðŸŸ£ Features

- **CARLA Simulator:** Provide realistic driving scenarios for training and testing.
- **DQN Algorithm:** Enables the agent to learn an optimal policy from trial-and-error.
- **LSTM Layers:** Provide memory of past states and actions.
- **Experience Replay:** Stores and reuses past transitions to improve sample efficiency.
